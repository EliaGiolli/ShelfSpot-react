## 🧪 Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as the test runner, along with [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/), [@testing-library/user-event](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/intro/), and [@testing-library/jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom) for writing and asserting UI tests.

### Running Tests

You can run all tests from the command line using:

```sh
npm test
```

This will execute all test files (e.g., [`Button.test.tsx`](src/components/Button.test.tsx), [`Input.test.tsx`](src/components/Input.test.tsx)) in your project and display the results in the console.

### Interactive Test UI

To run tests with the Vitest UI (for a visual, interactive experience):

```sh
npm run test:ui
```

This will open a browser window where you can see test results, re-run tests, and debug interactively.

### Notes

- All test files should be named with `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts` and placed alongside the components or in a `__tests__` folder.
- You can use the full power of Testing Library and Vitest for component, integration, and unit tests.
- For more information, see the [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/guide/) and [Testing Library docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/).
